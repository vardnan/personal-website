                  the largest Norwegian salad-farms could streamline their value

                  developed stakeholder maps, mapped out the socioeconomical

                  increased our familiarity with the farming industry through

                  we spent 2 days at the farm with a free rein to conduct
                  stakeholder interviews and detailed observations. In trying to
                  keep our reserach as human-centred as possible, we interviewed
                  key persons in every level of the farm’s organisational

                  — after each day at the farm, and the days therafter, our main
                  focus was defining the specific leverage points to increase
                  the farms’ operational efficiency. We came to the conclusion
                  that a 1% increase in their efficiency would result to a
                  €95,290 increase in their revenue, which became our target.

                  up-to-date research on potential solutions to our discovered
                  leverage points. Some of the topics we explored were RFID
                  technology, retrofitting modern information systems, and
                  cellular production processes. Potential solutions were
                  regularly discussed with key stakeholders at the farm to gain
                  insights into feasibility and budget constraints.

                <h2>3.0 Findings</h2>
                <p>
                  We found that the salad farm already had a forward-leaning
                  approach to implement modern solutions in their production
                  process, however we observed several points of improvements at
                  systemic level, where processes such as planning, control,
                  data collection, logging, and communication still were
                  impaired by manual work.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The latter points formed a significant bottleneck in their
                  internal and external information-flow. The same applied to
                  their supply chain, but here the main negative influences were
                  their lack of access to liquid capital and repurcussions from
                  previous economical decisions. Moreover, we found that the
                  greatest leverage point for increasing their operational
                  efficiency lied in their packing factory.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In addition, it must be pinpointed that several of the farm’s
                  challenges were greatly affected by complicated internal and
                  external stakeholder relationships. For example significant
                  language barriers among farmers, dependencies on the farm’s
                  CEO, and having a customer base of wholesalers with
                  significant market shares and considerable influence on the
                  farms’ operations.

                  whereas the second phase considered long-term investments for
